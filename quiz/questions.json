      "o1": { "s": "Sovereignty exists even if a vendor can unilaterally cancel your account.", "a": "false", "h": "If someone else holds the kill-switch, do you have autonomy?", "e": "You must have control over your own service availability and kill-switches." },

      "os2": { "s": "OSS software is 100% secure by default.", "a": "false", "h": "Does having the code mean it was written perfectly?", "e": "OSS provides the tools for security, but you must still patch and audit it." },

      "m2": { "s": "Managed services can be used sovereignly.", "a": "true", "h": "Can a managed service be sovereign if the contract is right?", "e": "Requires strong exit strategies, data escrow, and localised contracts." },
